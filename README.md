## About 

Hi, I'm Rishabh! I am currently pursuing MCA Integrated, I am on track to completing my degree in Data Analytics (Mr. Data Analyst). I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the Data Analytics field.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
